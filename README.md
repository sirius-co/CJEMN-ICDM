# CJEMN-ICDM
CJEMN Implementation

Here you can find the python implementation to run our method "Contrastive Joint Embedding for Multiplex Networks" (CJEMN), submitted to the ICDM 2025 conference.

To run our approach, you need first to unzip datasets into the data repository.

Then you can run our approach, by the following command:

python CJEMN.py datasetName

Example:
python CJEMN.py imdb
